    "1. Make a general template for geant4, which should be just including the most basic elements, so it can carry out more flexible setting\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setting up following setting in different repo\n",
    "- Na22 source\n",
    "- A single CsI crystal with SiPM attached to it. This setting is for simulating scintillator detector more realisticly\n",
    "- A Xenon gas with shielding plate, this setting is for simulating more realistic positornium generator\n",
    "- Quantum dot dark box setting (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For physics list\n",
    "- Verify from tom's positronium generation mechanism (how to import custom physics list)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For the generated data file, also sensitive detector setting\n",
    "- It should include: \n",
    "  - Scintillator detector, which count the number of optical photon corresponding to the event.\n",
    "  - Ideal detector, measuring the initial and final energy that a particular particle deposit inside the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For the particle generation, which should include\n",

    "# Expectation\n",

    "  - Detector name that it hit (Can be provided by hit)\n",
    "  - Scintillation count (Need toreport in a format track:# optical photon at the end of an Event)\n",
    "  - Energy deposition details (which likely not possible as heavily many resource will be taken)\n",
    "2. Provide a more realistic information of the setup\n",
    "  - Track ID (For mapping to ideal case)\n",
    "  - Parent ID (For mapping to ideal case)\n",

    "1. First generation particles (Which is everything generated by the Na22)\n",
    "2. Second generation particles (which is everything induced by the first generation particles)\n",
    "3. Third generation particles (optical photon)\n",
    "\n",

    "Few type of detector\n",
    "- Simply monitor (No other purpose but monitor the particles, an Ideal case, e.g. Toms monitoring of Na22 first generation particle at disk)\n",

    "- Tracker\n",
    "1. Initial data, including the first and second generation particle crossing (presteppoing) the geometrical boundary or creation inside the detector will be included.\n",
    "2. Last data, including the first and second generation particle crossing(poststeppoing) the geometrical boundary or killed inside the detector will be included.\n",

    "1. If a first generation particles generate a secondary particle in a scintillator, the secondary particle has the parent ID of the the first generation particles, the third generation particles having the parent ID of the second generation etc\n",
    "So in principle, we could have a map of track, which map the track ID into the number of optical photon count, then we make a listed map, which map all the tracks into their corresponding parent ID recursively, we will have a mapping from trackID(all generation) to trackID(first generation), then for each first generation particles, sum over all its secondary trackID optical photon count we will have the correspondance.\n",
